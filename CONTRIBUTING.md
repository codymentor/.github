# Contributing to CodyMentor Projects

## Our Mentorship-First Approach
We welcome contributions that align with our mission of mentorship-driven development.

## How to Contribute
1. **Find an Issue** - Look for issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted"
2. **Discuss First** - Comment on the issue before starting work
3. **Fork & Clone** - Fork the repo and clone it locally
4. **Create a Branch** - Use descriptive branch names: `feature/your-feature` or `fix/your-fix`
5. **Make Changes** - Follow our code style and add tests
6. **Submit Pull Request** - Reference the issue number

## Code Review Process
All PRs receive educational code reviews focusing on:
- Learning opportunities
- Best practices
- Alternative approaches
- Documentation improvements
